# argumentation-mining

# Abstract:
              The field of Argumentation Mining has arisen from the need of determining the underlying causes from an expressed opinion and the urgency to develop the established fields of Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis. The recent progress in the wider field of Artificial Intelligence in combination with the available data through Social Web has create great potential for every sub-field of Natural Language Process including Argumentation Mining.
